I keep math-heavy conversations with GPT open all day, so I am constantly copying inline and display equations or jumping back to earlier turns. This Chrome extension, **AI Chat Timeline & Interaction Helper**, makes both tasks much easier.

👉 Grab it here: [Chrome Web Store – AI Chat Timeline & Interaction Helper](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ai-chat-timeline-interact/fgebdnlceacaiaeikopldglhffljjlhh)

### Why it is useful

1. **One-click LaTeX copying.** The plugin parses each response, detects inline vs. display math, and gives you dedicated buttons to copy the exact LaTeX chunk without reformatting.
2. **Interactive conversation timeline.** Every prompt/response pair becomes a point on a horizontal timeline, so rewinding to a previous idea is as easy as clicking that node.
3. **Pinned favorites.** You can mark any turn; pinned items become quick shortcuts when the thread gets long.

### Screenshots

**Copy buttons for display-style equations**

If you rely on GPT (or Gemini, DeepSeek, etc.) for derivations or long discussions, this plugin is a gentle timesaver. Let me know if you try it or have alternatives I should test!
