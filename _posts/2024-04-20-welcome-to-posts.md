I wanted a lightweight place to jot down interesting observations, tools, or quick experiments—things that are too small for the main landing page but fun enough to share. This new posts section does exactly that.

<!-- Whenever there is a new note to publish, copy `_posts/_TEMPLATE.md`, rename it with the format `YYYY-MM-DD-my-title.md`, fill in the fields at the top, and start writing in Markdown. Jekyll takes care of the rest: the entry shows up automatically on the [posts page]({{ '/posts/' | relative_url }}) with the summary you provide, plus the full article lives at its own URL. -->
